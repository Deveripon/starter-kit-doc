# Welcome to Full Stack Monorepo Starter Kit 🚀

Building full-stack applications often involves setting up the same repetitive boilerplate: authentication, database connections, folder structures, and proxy configurations. This project was born out of a simple idea: **to make project bootstrapping instant and painless.**

This is a high-performance, type-safe starter kit built with a **Monorepo architecture**. It bridges the gap between **Next.js** (Frontend) and **Nest.js** (Backend) using a unified authentication layer.

## Why this Starter Kit?

Most starter kits focus on a single framework. This kit focuses on an **ecosystem**. It allows you to maintain a clean, decoupled backend with Nest.js while enjoying the cutting-edge frontend features of Next.js 15.

### Key Features
- **Monorepo Ready:** Scalable structure for large teams and projects.
- **Multiple Auth Flavors:** Choose between **Better Auth** (Recommended) or **Auth.js** based on your project needs.
- **AI-Enhanced UI:** Clean and responsive UI components generated and refined with **Gemini 3 Flash**.
- **Developer Experience:** Pre-configured proxies, detailed logging, and a dedicated CLI.

## Authentication Flavors

Every project has different needs. This kit provides two primary ways to handle authentication:

### 1. Better Auth (The Powerhouse)
Our primary version uses **Better Auth**. It features a shared database session strategy that works seamlessly across your Next.js frontend and Nest.js backend. 
- **Pros:** Robust session management, easy OAuth, and superior support for hybrid APIs (Browser & Postman).

### 2. Auth.js (The Classic)
For those who prefer the tried-and-tested ecosystem of NextAuth, we maintain a dedicated version using **Auth.js**.
- **Pros:** Massive community support and extensive social login providers.

## The CLI Tool 🛠️

To make things even easier, I've built a **custom CLI tool** that handles the heavy lifting for you. No more manual cloning or variable editing. 

With a single command, you can:
- Bootstrap a new project.
- Choose your preferred Auth provider (Better Auth or Auth.js).
- Configure environment variables automatically.

> We will cover the CLI usage and manual setup in the [Installation](/docs/installation) section.
