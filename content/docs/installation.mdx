# Installation Guide 🛠️

You can get started with the Next-Nest-Auth starter kit in two ways. Whether you prefer a guided terminal experience or full control via manual cloning, we've got you covered.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js:** version 20.x or higher.
- **Package Manager:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is highly recommended (and required for the monorepo workspace features).
- **Database:** A PostgreSQL instance (local or hosted like Neon/Supabase).

---

## Method 1: Interactive CLI (Recommended)

The fastest way to bootstrap your project is using our dedicated CLI tool, `create-next-nest`. It handles template selection and dependency installation automatically.

### 1. Run via pnpm dlx
You don't even need to install it. Just run:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-next-nest

```

### 2. Follow the Prompts

The CLI will guide you through the setup:

* **Project Name:** Choose a name for your application folder.
* **Authentication Library:** Select between **Better-Auth (Recommended)** or **Auth.js**.
* **Auto Install:** Select **Yes** to let the CLI run `pnpm install` for you.

### 3. Global Installation (Optional)

If you build projects frequently, install it globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g create-next-nest
# Then just run:
create-next-nest

```

---

## Method 2: Manual Installation (Git)

If you prefer to manually clone the repository and set things up, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Choose the version you want to use:

**For Better-Auth Version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deveripon/Next-Nest-Better-Auth.git my-app

```

**For Auth.js Version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deveripon/next-nest-auth-js-starterkit.git my-app

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and use `pnpm` to install workspace dependencies:

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install

```

---

## Environment Setup ⚙️

Once the files are ready, you need to configure your environment variables.

### 1. Backend Configuration

Navigate to `apps/backend` and create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd apps/backend
cp .env.example .env

```

Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:

* `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
* `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A random secure string.
* `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: `http://localhost:3000` (Your frontend URL).

### 2. Frontend Configuration

Navigate to `apps/frontend` and create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env

```

Update the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` to match the backend one.

---

## Database Initialization 🗄️

Since this project uses **Prisma**, you need to sync your schema with your database:

```bash
# From the root directory
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push

```

---

## Running the Project 🚀

Now you are ready to start the development servers! We use **Turborepo** to manage both frontend and backend simultaneously.

From the **root directory**, run:

```bash
pnpm dev

```

This command will start:

* **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
* **Backend:** [http://localhost:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:5000)
* **Documentation:** [http://localhost:3001](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3001) (if included)

---

## Troubleshooting

* **CORS Issues:** Ensure your `BETTER_AUTH_URL` in the backend `.env` matches your frontend's actual URL.
* **Prisma Errors:** Double check that your `DATABASE_URL` is correct and your database server is running.
* **Pnpm Workspace:** If dependencies fail, try running `pnpm store prune` and then `pnpm install`.
